        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="justified-text">Hello, I am Jamie Jones Pukari Cera, but you can call me Jam. I was born in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea on March 5, 1999. My Father is a Filipino while my mother is from Papua New Guinea. When I was 8 years old, we were brought to the Philippines and Lived in Mapandan, Pangasinan. I studied Elemntary and High School
        at Mapandan Catholic School and Senior High School at Mapandan National High School. After 11 years, We then moved to Quezon City to continue for college.  I am currently pursuing my college degree at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines with the course Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I am currently residing with my relatives at U.P Campus, Quezon City.<br>
        <br>

        After graduating college, I am hoping to work abroad and also finish my novel. I am also a fan of Stan Lee of Marvel. I like watching historical movies, documentaries, and movies that are inspiring, including superhero movies. I am an adventurous person. I like eating veggie salads, boiled potatoes, apples, mango, grahams, and spaghetti. I am also learning French and Italian, because I find it fun to learn. I also like traveling, and being alone sometimes. I also like solving puzzles, like chess and rubiks cube -- it is just that I feel attracted to solving puzzles. I am not sure if I really want to pursue to become a Software Engineer/Data Analyst, but I'll make a note, I will try. </p>
